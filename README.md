Mobile coding with Claude Code, without the pain.

## Vision

Mobile programming has always been painful: small screens, awkward keyboards, tedious operations. Pockode aims to change this entirely by providing a new mobile development experience.

## Core Philosophy

**AI-first editing, manual editing as backup**

Traditional solutions try to squeeze desktop editors into phone screens—this is the wrong approach. Pockode uses conversational interaction:

- Describe what you want in natural language
- AI understands your intent and makes the changes
- You just review and confirm

## Features

### Conversational Development
Complete most development tasks through a chat interface with AI:
- Write and modify code
- Refactor and optimize
- Debug and troubleshoot
- Explain and learn code

### Git Operations
No need to memorize commands—use natural language for version control:
- "Commit these changes"
- "Create a new branch feature/login"
- "Merge to main"
- "Show recent commits"

### Manual Editing
When you do need to edit manually:
- Syntax highlighting
- Quick action panel

## Status

Under active development.

## Feedback

Issues and suggestions are welcome. Code contributions are not accepted during early development due to frequent refactoring.
